# Manitoba Electricity Flow Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of Manitoba's seasonal electricity flows using a publicly available IESO dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying trends and anomalies in electricity imports, exports, and flows across different seasons.

## Overview
Using Python's **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**, this project processes raw data, extracts seasonal trends, and visualizes key insights into Manitoba's electricity activity:
- **Winter** shows the highest electricity loads due to increased demand.
- **Summer** reflects moderate activity with lower imports and exports.
- **Other seasons** highlight anomalies, such as the highest annual import peak and negative flow means.

- ## Visualizations
The repository includes a stacked bar chart showcasing Manitoba's seasonal electricity trends for imports, exports, and flows.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedr1zwan/Manitoba-Seasonal-Data-Analysis.git

2. Install the required Python libraries:
